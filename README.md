# Image Clasifier

A PyTorch Model for classifyng playing cards using this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification).

This was a quick and fun exercise for me to get accustomed to PyTorch, from understanding the dataset, to what it means to train the model and how to create a training loop.
